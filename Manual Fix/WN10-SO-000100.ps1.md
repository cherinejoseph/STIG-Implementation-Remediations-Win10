# STIG Overview: WN10-SO-000100

### Vulnerability Discussion:

The **Server Message Block (SMB)** protocol is a network file-sharing protocol that allows applications to read and write to files and request services from server programs in a computer network. SMB operates on top of TCP/IP and NetBIOS over TCP/IP. Itâ€™s used for file and printer sharing, as well as communication between network devices.

One of the vulnerabilities of SMB is its susceptibility to **man-in-the-middle (MITM) attacks**. Without encryption or packet signing, malicious actors can intercept, modify, or inject data into SMB communication between clients and servers.

**SMB Packet Signing** adds a digital signature to SMB packets to ensure the integrity and authenticity of the communication. If packet signing is not enabled, an attacker can alter SMB packets to launch attacks.

To mitigate this risk, it is recommended that **SMB packet signing** be enforced. When this policy is applied, the SMB client will only communicate with SMB servers that also perform packet signing, preventing potential MITM attacks.

### Manual Check:

To verify that this security feature is enabled on the system, check the registry for the appropriate configuration:

1. Open **Registry Editor** by typing `regedit` in the **Run** dialog box (press **Windows+R**).
2. Navigate to the following path:  
   `HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\LanmanWorkstation\Parameters`
3. Look for the registry value **RequireSecuritySignature**.
   - If it **exists** and the value is set to **1**, SMB packet signing is enabled.
   - If it is **missing** or not set to **1**, SMB packet signing is **not enabled**.

If this registry value does not exist or is not configured to 1, then the system is not enforcing SMB packet signing, and this will be flagged as a finding.

---

### Manual Fix:

To configure the system to always perform SMB packet signing, follow these steps:

#### Method 1: Using Group Policy (Recommended)

1. Open **Group Policy Management** (type `gpedit.msc` in the Run dialog).
2. Navigate to the following path:  
   `Computer Configuration > Windows Settings > Security Settings > Local Policies > Security Options`
3. Find the policy **Microsoft network client: Digitally sign communications (always)**.
4. **Enable** this policy by setting it to **Enabled**.
5. After enabling the policy, run the following command to ensure that the update is applied correctly:
   ```bash
   gpupdate /force


#### Method 2: Manual Registry Edit

1. Open **Registry Editor** (`regedit`).
2. Navigate to:  
   `HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\LanmanWorkstation\Parameters`
3. If the `RequireSecuritySignature` entry doesn't exist, create it:
   - Right-click on the right pane and select **New > DWORD (32-bit) Value**.
   - Name it `RequireSecuritySignature`.
   - Set the **Value data** to **1**.
4. Close the Registry Editor and restart the system to apply changes.

---

### Summary:

- **SMB Packet Signing** is a crucial security feature to protect against man-in-the-middle (MITM) attacks.
- The **registry value** `RequireSecuritySignature` must be set to `1` under `HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\LanmanWorkstation\Parameters\`.
- Ensure the Group Policy setting **Microsoft network client: Digitally sign communications (always)** is enabled.
