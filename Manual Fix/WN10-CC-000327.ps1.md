## Vulnerability Discussion:
PowerShell Transcription helps maintain an audit trail of all PowerShell activity. It logs each command and script executed in PowerShell, which is valuable for forensic analysis, detecting malware, and investigating security incidents. PowerShell is a powerful automation and scripting tool, but it can also be abused by attackers to execute malicious code or bypass traditional security tools. Without proper logging, it can be extremely difficult to detect such activity.

Enabling PowerShell Transcription creates detailed logs of all commands and scripts executed through PowerShell. These logs can help security teams analyze suspicious behavior, investigate incidents, and maintain an audit trail. Without transcription enabled, malicious activity using PowerShell may go undetected.

## Manual check:

### Option 1: Check Registry:
Ensure this registry key and value exist:

- **Registry Hive**: `HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE`
- **Path**: `\SOFTWARE\Policies\Microsoft\Windows\PowerShell\Transcription\`
- **Value Name**: `EnableTranscripting`
- **Value Type**: `REG_DWORD`
- **Value Data**: `1` (enabled)

If the key or value is missing or not set to 1, this is a finding.

### Option 2: Check via Group Policy Editor

1. Press `Windows + R`, type `gpedit.msc`, and press Enter.
2. Navigate to:  
   `Local Computer Policy > Computer Configuration > Administrative Templates > Windows Components > Windows PowerShell`
3. Look for the policy named **"Turn on PowerShell Transcription"**.
4. If it is "Not Configured" or "Disabled", this is non-compliant.

## Manual Fix:

### Option 1: Fix via Registry Editor

1. Press `Windows + R`, type `regedit`, and press Enter.
2. Navigate to:  
   `HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Policies\Microsoft\Windows\PowerShell\Transcription`
3. If the path doesn't exist, create it.
4. Add or modify the following values:
   - `EnableTranscripting` (REG_DWORD) = `1`
   - `OutputDirectory` (REG_SZ) = `\\LogServer\Transcripts$` (replace with your secure path)

### Option 2: Fix via Group Policy

1. Open `gpedit.msc`.
2. Navigate to:  
   `Local Computer Policy > Computer Configuration > Administrative Templates > Windows Components > Windows PowerShell`
3. Double-click **"Turn on PowerShell Transcription"**.
4. Set the policy to **Enabled**.
5. Specify a secure location for the Transcript output directory, such as a central log server (e.g., `\\LogServer\Transcripts$`).

## Important Notes:

- The output directory should be secured (e.g., a write-only network share) to prevent tampering by users.
- Ensure transcription logs are regularly monitored for suspicious activity.
- If the system is domain-joined and governed by Group Policy, registry changes may be overridden at the next policy refresh unless Group Policy is updated.
- Use with **Script Block Logging** for comprehensive PowerShell auditing.
