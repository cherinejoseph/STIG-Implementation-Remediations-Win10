# WN10-CC-000335

## Vulnerability Discussion

The vulnerability addresses the Windows Remote Management (WinRM) client’s configuration, specifically its handling of unencrypted traffic. Unencrypted traffic over WinRM can expose sensitive information, potentially allowing attackers to intercept or eavesdrop on communication between the client and server.

This STIG ensures that the WinRM client disallows unencrypted traffic, which is a critical security measure for ensuring confidentiality and integrity in communications.

### Check Criteria

The system must be checked to ensure that the WinRM client does not allow unencrypted traffic.

**Registry Key:**

- **Path:** `HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Policies\Microsoft\Windows\WinRM\Client\`
- **Key Name:** `AllowUnencryptedTraffic`
- **Value Type:** `REG_DWORD`
- **Required Value:** `0` (which means disabling unencrypted traffic)

If this registry value is missing or incorrectly configured, it is considered a finding.

For this STIG, WN10-CC-000335, which relates to configuring Windows Remote Management (WinRM) to not allow unencrypted traffic, here's how to go about it:

## Manual Check

### 1. Registry Check  
You need to ensure that the following registry key exists and is set to 0 (disabled):  
- Registry Path: `HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Policies\Microsoft\Windows\WinRM\Client\`  
- Registry Key: `AllowUnencryptedTraffic`  
- Registry Value: `REG_DWORD`  
- Registry Setting: 0 (Disabled)

### 2. Group Policy Check  
You can also check the Group Policy setting:  
- Group Policy Path:  
  `Computer Configuration >> Administrative Templates >> Windows Components >> Windows Remote Management (WinRM) >> WinRM Client >> Allow unencrypted traffic`  
- Setting: Set to **"Disabled"**.

---

## Manual Steps for Fixing the STIG:

### 1. Open the Registry Editor  
- Press `Windows + R` to open the Run dialog.  
- Type `regedit` and press Enter. This will open the Registry Editor.

### 2. Navigate to the Registry Path  
In Registry Editor, navigate to the following path:

`HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Policies\Microsoft\Windows\WinRM\Client\`

- Expand `HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE`.  
- Expand `SOFTWARE`.  
- Expand `Policies`.  
- Expand `Microsoft`.  
- Expand `Windows`.  
- Look for the `WinRM` key, and under it, the `Client` key.

### 3. Create the Registry Key (if not already present)  
If you don’t see the `WinRM` or `Client` key, you’ll need to create them manually:  
- Create the `WinRM` Key (if it doesn’t exist):  
  1. Right-click on the `Windows` key.  
  2. Select New > Key.  
  3. Name the new key `WinRM`.  
- Create the `Client` Key (if it doesn’t exist):  
  1. Right-click on the `WinRM` key.  
  2. Select New > Key.  
  3. Name the new key `Client`.

### 4. Create the `AllowUnencryptedTraffic` Value  
Once you have the `Client` key:  
1. Right-click on the `Client` key.  
2. Select New > DWORD (32-bit) Value.  
3. Name the new value `AllowUnencryptedTraffic`.

### 5. Set the Value to 0  
- Double-click the `AllowUnencryptedTraffic` value.  
- In the Edit DWORD (32-bit) Value window, set the Value data to 0.  
  - Value data: 0 means disabled (no unencrypted traffic allowed).  
- Click OK to save the changes.

### 6. Verify the Registry Setting  
After making these changes, verify that the registry setting is correct:  
1. Ensure that the `AllowUnencryptedTraffic` value exists under  
   `HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Policies\Microsoft\Windows\WinRM\Client\`.  
2. Make sure that the value is set to 0 (this disables unencrypted traffic for WinRM).


This fix is important for securing WinRM communications, ensuring that they are encrypted and thus safe from interception or tampering.

## Group Policy Automation (Optional)

If you're managing Group Policy via PowerShell, you can also automate the setting of the Group Policy value. Here's how you would ensure that the "Allow unencrypted traffic" setting is Disabled:

```powershell
# Ensure Group Policy setting is applied to disable unencrypted traffic in WinRM

$gpSetting = "Allow unencrypted traffic"
$gpPolicyPath = "Computer Configuration\Administrative Templates\Windows Components\Windows Remote Management (WinRM)\WinRM Client"

# Import the Group Policy module
Import-Module GroupPolicy

# Set the Group Policy to "Disabled"
Set-GPRegistryValue -Name "WinRM Client Settings" -Key "HKLM\SOFTWARE\Policies\Microsoft\Windows\WinRM\Client" -ValueName "AllowUnencryptedTraffic" -Type DWord -Value 0

# Confirm the Group Policy setting
Get-GPRegistryValue -Name "WinRM Client Settings" -Key "HKLM\SOFTWARE\Policies\Microsoft\Windows\WinRM\Client" -ValueName "AllowUnencryptedTraffic"
```
This ensures that the policy is set correctly across multiple machines if you're using Group Policy in an Active Directory environment.

## Registry and Group Policy

You don’t necessarily need to check the Group Policy if you are directly managing the registry, as the registry setting will override the Group Policy if it is configured correctly. However, it’s generally a best practice to check the Group Policy as well because Group Policy is a more comprehensive method of managing settings across multiple machines, particularly in an enterprise environment.

### Here’s when you might want to check the Group Policy:

#### **For Centralized Management**  
If you are using Group Policy to manage multiple systems across a domain, then it’s important to check and configure the Group Policy. Group Policy will enforce the setting consistently across all machines that are part of the policy scope.

#### **If the Registry Setting Isn’t Applied Correctly**  
Sometimes, even if the registry is set manually or through a script, Group Policy might have a higher precedence and overwrite local registry settings. In such cases, confirming Group Policy settings can help.

#### **To Ensure Long-Term Compliance**  
Group Policy can enforce settings on a regular basis and can be used to remediate any misconfigurations automatically, while the registry setting can be manually changed back unless Group Policy is also used to manage it.

## About WinRM

**WinRM (Windows Remote Management)** is a protocol used by Windows systems for remote management. It allows administrators to remotely execute commands, retrieve information, and configure settings on machines within the network. WinRM is based on the **WS-Management (Web Services Management)** protocol, which is a standard for managing servers and devices over a network using web services.

---

### WinRM Communications

WinRM communications refer to the exchange of data between a client (e.g., an administrator's machine) and a server (the machine being managed) using the WinRM protocol.  
When an administrator remotely manages a Windows system using PowerShell or other management tools, those commands and responses are sent via WinRM.

---

### What WinRM is Used For

- **Remote PowerShell Sessions:**  
  Administrators use WinRM to run PowerShell commands or scripts on remote computers, enabling remote management without needing to physically access the machine.

- **Remote Command Execution:**  
  WinRM can execute commands or batch scripts remotely on a machine, whether for troubleshooting, system configuration, or automation tasks.

- **System Management:**  
  It is also used in **System Center Configuration Manager (SCCM)**, **Group Policy**, and other enterprise management tools for managing configurations across many systems.

- **Monitoring and Gathering Data:**  
  WinRM allows administrators to gather event logs, system performance data, and other metrics remotely.

---

### Types of WinRM Communications

WinRM allows two primary modes of communication:

1. **HTTP (Port 5985):**  
   This is the default, unencrypted communication channel. **Not recommended for production environments** because the data is sent in plain text, which can be intercepted by attackers.

2. **HTTPS (Port 5986):**  
   This uses **TLS encryption** to secure the communication between the client and server.  
   It ensures that the data transmitted is encrypted and protected from eavesdropping or tampering.  
   **Highly recommended** for remote management, especially in production or sensitive environments.

---

### Why Encrypting WinRM Communications is Critical

Without encryption, WinRM communications are sent as plaintext.  
If attackers gain access to the network, they could potentially intercept sensitive data like login credentials, configuration commands, or system information.

To mitigate this risk, WinRM should be configured to disallow unencrypted traffic, which is what the STIG **WN10-CC-000335** addresses.  
The STIG mandates that unencrypted WinRM traffic is disabled, enforcing the use of encrypted communications (via HTTPS).

---

### In the Context of the STIG (WN10-CC-000335)

The `AllowUnencryptedTraffic` registry setting ensures that unencrypted WinRM traffic is disabled.  
If this setting is left at the default enabled state, an attacker could intercept unencrypted management traffic.  
The STIG requires you to disable this by setting the registry value to `0`, which ensures that all WinRM communication is encrypted (using HTTPS).


WinRM communications are crucial for managing remote systems, especially in enterprise environments.  
Ensuring these communications are encrypted prevents the risk of sensitive data being exposed during remote management tasks.
