# WN10-UC-000015

## Overview
The STIG ID **WN10-UC-000015** requires that **toast notifications on the Windows 10 lock screen must be disabled**. Toast notifications are pop-up alerts used by apps and the operating system to display messages. When these appear on the lock screen, they can expose sensitive information to unauthorized individuals. Disabling this feature helps protect user data when a system is unattended.

---

## Description
By default, Windows may show notifications such as calendar reminders, emails, or system messages on the lock screen. If a user leaves their system unattended, others could potentially see these messages without logging in. This setting ensures that only authenticated users can view notifications, thereby reducing the risk of information leakage.

---

## Vulnerability Discussion

- The registry value `NoToastApplicationNotificationOnLockScreen` determines whether toast notifications are shown on the lock screen.
- If this value is not set or is set incorrectly, sensitive information may be exposed to unauthorized viewers.
- Disabling toast notifications at the lock screen is particularly important in environments where devices are publicly accessible or shared among users.
