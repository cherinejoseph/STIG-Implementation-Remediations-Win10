### Vulnerability Discussion

The built-in **"Guest"** account is a default, widely-known account on Windows systems that, by default, does **not require a password**. This could be exploited by unauthorized users to gain access to system resources.

**Renaming the account** helps to obscure it and prevent unauthorized access, thereby enhancing system security.

### Check

1. **Run the Group Policy Editor**  
   - Open the Start Menu.  
   - Type `gpedit.msc` and press **Enter**.

2. **Navigate to the following path:**  
   `Local Computer Policy > Computer Configuration > Windows Settings > Security Settings > Local Policies > Security Options`

3. **Check the setting:**  
   - Look for: **Accounts: Rename guest account**
   - If this setting is **set to "Guest"**, it is **non-compliant** and must be changed.

---

### Fix

1. Open the Group Policy Editor (`gpedit.msc`)
2. Navigate to:  
   `Local Computer Policy > Computer Configuration > Windows Settings > Security Settings > Local Policies > Security Options`
3. Double-click **Accounts: Rename guest account**
4. Change the value to a name **other than "Guest"**  
   - Example: `"SystemAccess"` or another **non-obvious**, **custom** name
5. Click **OK** to apply the changes

This action reduces the risk of **unauthorized access** through the guest account and **strengthens system security** by removing a well-known attack vector.

### Important Notes

- The **new name** should be something **non-obvious** and **unique**
- Make sure to **document** the new account name for **future reference**
- **Test** after applying the change to ensure it **does not interfere** with other system processes
