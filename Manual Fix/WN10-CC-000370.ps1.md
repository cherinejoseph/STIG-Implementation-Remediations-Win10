# WN10-CC-000370

The STIG ID **WN10-CC-000370** addresses the requirement that the **convenience PIN sign-in** feature for Windows 10 must be disabled. This is important for security, as allowing a domain user to sign in with a PIN could potentially make the system vulnerable to "password stuffing" attacks or other types of credential exploitation. By disabling the PIN sign-in, organizations ensure that only more secure login methods, like passwords or multifactor authentication (MFA), are used.

## Description:
Convenience PINs can be less secure compared to traditional passwords and could potentially be exploited, particularly if there are repeated failed login attempts or if the PIN is weak. This setting ensures that convenience PINs are not used in a domain environment.

## Vulnerability Discussion:
- The **AllowDomainPINLogon** registry setting is used to control whether domain users can sign in using a PIN.
- If this setting is not configured correctly (or is configured to allow PIN logins), the system would be vulnerable to unauthorized access via the PIN mechanism, which is considered less secure than a more complex password system.

## Manual Check:
To check if the **AllowDomainPINLogon** registry setting is configured correctly, perform the following steps:

1. **Open the Registry Editor:**
   - Press `Win + R`, type `regedit`, and press `Enter`.

2. **Navigate to the registry path:**
   - `HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\Policies\Microsoft\Windows\System`

3. **Verify the registry key:**
   - Look for a key named `AllowDomainPINLogon`.
   - If it exists, ensure its value is set to `0`. If it's set to any other value (or is missing entirely), it needs to be fixed.

4. **Check if PIN sign-in is disabled through Group Policy (alternative check):**
   - Open the **Group Policy Editor** (`gpedit.msc`).
   - Navigate to `Computer Configuration > Administrative Templates > System > Logon`.
   - Check the policy setting **Turn on convenience PIN sign-in**. This should be set to **Disabled**.

5. If the value is not set to "Disabled," this is a finding.

## Fix:
There are two ways to fix this issue, either by modifying the registry directly or through Group Policy.

### **Fix via Registry:**
1. Open **Registry Editor** (`regedit`).
2. Navigate to the path:
   - `HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\Policies\Microsoft\Windows\System`
3. If the `AllowDomainPINLogon` key doesnâ€™t exist, create it:
   - Right-click on the **System** folder, select **New > DWORD (32-bit) Value**.
   - Name it `AllowDomainPINLogon`.
   - Set its value to `0`.
4. Close the registry editor and reboot the system for changes to take effect.

### **Fix via Group Policy:**
1. Open **Group Policy Editor** (`gpedit.msc`).
2. Navigate to:
   - `Computer Configuration > Administrative Templates > System > Logon`
3. Find and set the **Turn on convenience PIN sign-in** policy to **Disabled**.
4. Apply the changes and reboot the system.

This will ensure that convenience PIN sign-in is disabled on all domain-joined Windows 10 systems and that the machine is compliant with the STIG requirement for **WN10-CC-000370**.
