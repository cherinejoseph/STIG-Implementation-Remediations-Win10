# STIG ID: WN10-UR-000160

## Description

The **"Restore files and directories"** user right determines which users can bypass normal file and directory permissions when restoring backed-up data. This is a powerful privilege that should be restricted to trusted administrative accounts only.

Improper assignment of this right may allow a user to:

- Overwrite or restore files regardless of existing NTFS permissions
- Place outdated, malicious, or unauthorized files into sensitive locations
- Gain access to data they would otherwise not be permitted to view or modify

These actions pose a risk to system integrity, confidentiality, and availability. To minimize exposure, only the built-in **Administrators** group must be assigned this user right.

## Vulnerability Discussion

Inappropriate granting of user rights can provide system, administrative, or high-level access capabilities.

Accounts with the **"Restore files and directories"** user right can circumvent file and directory permissions and gain access to sensitive data. This access can be misused to overwrite critical or current data, possibly leading to system compromise or data loss. Therefore, strict control over this setting is required.

## Manual Check Procedure

1. Press `Windows + R`, type `gpedit.msc`, and press Enter to open the **Local Group Policy Editor**.
2. Navigate to the following location:


   ```plaintext
   Local Computer Policy
   └── Computer Configuration
       └── Windows Settings
           └── Security Settings
               └── Local Policies
                   └── User Rights Assignment
   ```
   
3. Locate and open the policy setting: Restore files and directories.
4. Review the list of assigned users or groups.

**Compliant:** Only the Administrators group is listed.

**Non-Compliant (Finding):** Any additional users or groups (e.g., Backup Operators, Users, custom service accounts) are listed.

## Manual Fix

To remediate the setting:

1. Open the **Local Group Policy Editor** (`gpedit.msc`) or use the **Group Policy Management Console (GPMC)** for domain-managed systems.

2. Navigate to the following path (same as above)

```plaintext
   Local Computer Policy
   └── Computer Configuration
       └── Windows Settings
           └── Security Settings
               └── Local Policies
                   └── User Rights Assignment
   ```

3. Locate and double-click **Restore files and directories**.

4. Remove all users and groups **except** for the **Administrators** group.

5. Click **Apply** and then **OK** to confirm the changes.

6. Run the following command in **Command Prompt** to immediately apply the policy update:

***gpupdate /force***

Alternatively, you can reboot the system or wait for the Group Policy to refresh automatically.
